Hello

my program is written for processing photos, in it you can brighten pictures, rotate and darken them

when you run the code, a window opens in which there is a button to open files on your PC, you select a photo and it is displayed on the main window, then you can change it with three types of processing

after you have processed the photos, you can save it, there is also a built-in button that opens the available files on the computer and gives you the opportunity to choose where exactly to save it
